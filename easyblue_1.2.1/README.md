### Organize your business! Exploit human resources that can be used in other tasks more efficiently.

**Easy!Appointments** is a highly customizable web application that allows your customers to book
appointments with you via the web. Moreover, it provides the ability to sync your data with
Google Calendar so you can use them with other services. It is an open source project and you
can download and install it **even for commercial use**. Easy!Appointments will run smoothly with
your existing website, because it can be installed in a single folder of the server and of course,
both sites can share the same database.

### Features
The project was designed to be flexible and reliable so as to be able to meet the needs of any
kind of enterprise. You can read the main features of the system below:

* Full customers and appointments management.
* Services and service providers organization.
* Workflow and booking rules.
* Google Calendar synchronization.
* Email notifications system.
* Standalone installation (like WordPress, Joomla! and other web systems).
* Translated user interface.
* User community support.

### Installation
Since Easy!Appointments is a web application, it runs on a web server and thus you will need to
perform the following steps in order to install the system on your server:

* Make sure that your server has Apache, PHP and MySQL installed.
* Create a new database (or use an existing).
* Copy the "easyappointments" source folder on your server.
